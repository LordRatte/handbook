# Finalising Replit tutorials


Writers provide tutorials in different formats, both in terms of code and the write up. You need to convert them so that the write up exists as a branch of [our fork of their docs](https://github.com/ritza-co/replit.github.io/) and the code exists as a repl on our team account.
