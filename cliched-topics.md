# Cliched projects and topics

There are some projects that are used so often in tutorials and example projects that they have become cliched. We avoid these (this is a non-exhaustive list).

## Micro blog site or Twitter clone 
- A twitter clone or other simple microblogging site where people can post messages

## To do list or Trello clone
- A todo list or Kanban board

## Temperature / other conversion tools
- a way to convert celsius to fahrenheit or similar conversions (inches to cm, etc)
